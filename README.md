# ![World Meteorological Organization](https://community.wmo.int/themes/wmo/logo.png) WMO Task Team on Climate Data Model (TT-CDM)
The WMO Task Team on Climate Data Model is a team under the [WMO Expert Team on Metadata Standards](https://community.wmo.int/en/governance/commission-membership/commission-observation-infrastructure-and-information-systems-infcom/standing-committee-information-management-and-technology-sc-imt/expert-team-metadata-standards-et-metadata) and the 
[WMO Standing Committee on Information Management and Technology](https://community.wmo.int/en/governance/commission-membership/commission-observation-infrastructure-and-information-systems-infcom/commission-infrastructure-officers/infcom-management-group/standing-committee-information-management-and-technology-sc-imt). 
The Team was set-up early in 2022 to lead the development of a data model for use in Climate Data Management Systems (CDMSs) and the representation,
exchange and archival of climate data. This repository contains the working documents and code used in the development of the data model.

The official page for the Task Team can be found on the [WMO Community Page](https://community.wmo.int/en/governance/commission-membership/commission-observation-infrastructure-and-information-systems-infcom/standing-committee-information-management-and-technology-sc-imt/expert-team-metadata-standards-et-metadata/task-team-climate-data-model-tt-cdm). 

## Terms of Reference
- Develop and maintain a WMO standard data model for the representation, exchange and archival of climate data in support of Climate Data Management Systems (CDMSs) in line with the WIGOS Metadata Representation and according to the requirements provided by ET-DRC.
- Coordinate with relevant WMO expert teams such as ET-Data, ET-Metadata, ET-IM, to align the data model with existing WMO standards.
- Support the OpenCDMS project in the implementation of the data model (Res. 22 (Cg-18); Res 4.2(17) (EC-73)).

## Publication and release

The official WMO data model for climate data and standard will be published in the appropriate WMO manual.
 This repository will be used for drafting the text, and other technical information, that will be used to draft that standrd.
 Once ready for official submission and review the draft documentation will published and released as version 1.0.beta 
 in parallel with submission through the appropriate WMO technical commissions.   

Any version prior to `v1.0.beta` should be considered experimental and subject to change at short notice.
